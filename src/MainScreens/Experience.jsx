            My team and I developed a Dense Neural Network and a Support Vector Machine to classify emission-line galaxies into Seyferts, Star-Forming, Composite, and LINERs. Data was collected from the Sloan-Digital Sky Survey, and our models were trained and built using scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras. Both models achieved a classification accuracy of above 92% in classifying galaxies. We submitted our paper to the American Astronomical Research Society, and it was published in March 2024.

I developed thread scheduling algorithms and synchronization techniques like semaphores to prevent race conditions. I also implemented system calls to bridge user and kernel spaces and designed a virtual memory system with paging and swapping for efficient memory management. Additionally, I built a file system with a hierarchical directory structure, supporting essential operations like file creation, reading, and deletion.'

I implemented Instruction Pipelining, including fetching, decoding, and executing assembly instructions that were given. In addition, I handled any data or control hazards that arose while processing. In addition, I implemented a basic cache system, that used the LRU policy to evict and bring in new cache lines into the cache.'

Using Jeff Sackmans database of all professional match information from 2013, I attempted to plot the performance of my favorite tennis players using different metrics. Using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Jupyter Notebook, I analyzed how the performance of players changed over time and in respect to different factors such as court type, constructing features such as serve percentage and breakpoint percentage, and splicing the large dataset into smaller datasets.'

The app leverages a Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG) model integrated with GPT, using medically approved treatment plans as contextual data to generate personalized care recommendations. This ensures that the recommendations align with established medical guidelines while being tailored to the unique needs of each patient.
